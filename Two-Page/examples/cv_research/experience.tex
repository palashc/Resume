		\begin{itemize}
			\item {
				Developed POC of a \textbf{unified annotation tool} which automatically detects the annotation user is trying to make. Trained CNN for detecting tool (highlight/underline/strikethrough/polygons) given user drawings and pdf context. Idea got selected to be shipped with the March release of Adobe Acrobat
			}
			\item {
				Engineered an efficient algorithm for the synchronization of sticky comments between PDFNext (HTML based PDF format) and Classic PDF inside Adobe Acrobat. %The challenge was to associate user click on HTML document to the most relevant textual/graphical content.
			}
			\item {
				Fixed more than ten critical security vulnerabilities (including buffer overflow vulnerabilities and javascript parameter tempering) inside Adobe Acrobat. % Severity ranged from the crash of the application on launching malicious pdf to granting full read/write permissions of the user to the attacker.
			}
