	{Automatic Abstract Generation for research papers} % Organization
	{IIT Kanpur, India} % Location
	{Aug. - Nov. 2016} % Date(s)
	{
		\begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
			\item The important sentences are first extracted from the paper text and fed to an abstractive model which outputs the final summary for the paper
			\item Word frequency based scores, text rank and latent semantic analysis were experimented for extraction. We uses a RNN encoder-decoder network to generate the final abstract. Model was evaluated using ROGUE metric.

	{Densecap with NMS Convenet} % Organization
	{IIT Kanpur, India} % Location
	{Aug. - Nov. 2016} % Date(s)
	{
		\begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
			\item Aim was to choose a problem, implement/reproduce approximate results from an existing paper and finally go beyond that work by identifying some weakness and improving on it. We choose the paper \textit{DenseCap: Fully Convolutional Localization Networks for Dense Captioning}
			\item Inspired from the future works given by the authors i.e. to discard test-time NMS in favor of a trainable spatial suppression layer and the nms-convenet model presented by work-\textit{A convnet for non-maximum suppression},  we enhanced the proposed model. We implemented and trained the nms-convenet using Keras. 
			\item We were able to enhance the mAP of densecap from 5.698 to 5.76. Meanwhile, we learnt about Convolutional networks, Localization networks, Recognition network and Lanuguage model. The code was implemented using Torch, LuaJIT, Keras and python.
